# Magnet Splitter

The purpose of this device is safe separation and manipulation of magnets. Manipulation can likely be done with simpler tools but at some of difficulty and a little danger. The design of this tool is minimalist and should be able to be constructed out of a single piece of wood and one bolt with washer and nut.

## Design Files

The model was developed using [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org). All required information is contained in the [magnet_splitter.fcstd](./magnet_splitter.fcstd) file. This design is parameterizable using the Parameters spreadsheet contained in the model. By changing the values in the spreadsheet the model will automatically adapt. This way you can adapt the design easily to whatever supplies are easiest for you to obtain.

The following terminology is used within the design files.

- Base - the board upon which the splitter rests to hold for stability
- Anchor - the board used to hold the magnet for separation (the one with the cutout)
- Handle - the board used to apply leaverage that "cuts" against the anchor
- Wedge - the section removed from the handle (can latter be used to pair magnets)
- Cutout - the section removed from the anchor to hold the magnet in place

## Design Influences

The tool is loosely based on the design by [K&J Magnetics](https://www.kjmagnetics.com) which can be [purchased](https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=MAGS1&cat=196). They also provide [instructions](https://www.kjmagnetics.com/buildamagnetseparator.asp) to build a similar device. This design is also influenced by splitter built by Brian the producer of the YouTube channel [Brainiac75](https://www.youtube.com/user/brainiac75/) which he demonstrates in his [video](https://youtu.be/ybY_wdQ5MSc).

## Contributions

This design was created by [Luke Newmeyer](http://www.lukenewmeyer.com) to save other engineers and enthusiasts time and effort. I am a strong believer in not wasting time and getting down to the main project objectives. If your project requires separating and manipulating magnets I hope you will be able to leverage this design and minimize the amount of time fiddling around with details.

Contributions and input from other developers is welcome. Feel free to use or adjust the model as desired.

Best of luck!
